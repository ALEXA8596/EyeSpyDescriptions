  <p>
   <a href=""https://www.littleeyesinternational.com/"">Little Eyes International</a>, a dedicated 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Arizona, is committed to preventing and curing childhood blindness. The organization focuses on providing essential optical, clinical, and surgical eye care services to underserved children, particularly those in Arizona and Mexico. Recognizing the global shortage of pediatric ophthalmologists and optometrists, and therefore limited access to care, Little Eyes International works tirelessly to address the critical need for accessible vision care.
  </p>

  <p>
   Little Eyes International understands the importance of early intervention and comprehensive eye care.  The organization's mission extends beyond simply providing glasses; it encompasses complete eye exams, diagnosis and treatment of various childhood ocular diseases such as Amblyopia and Strabismus, and eye care education. Furthermore,  surgery is offered for conditions like Strabismus, Nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and other vision-threatening conditions, which can greatly improve a child's quality of life. Also, because many causes of childhood blindness are preventable with timely intervention, Little Eyes International strives to ensure that children receive the care they require from a young age.
  </p>

  <p>
   Founded in July 2021 by Dr. Laura Kueny and Dr. Patrick Burke, Little Eyes International initiated its efforts by partnering with the Rocky Point Medical Center in Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, Mexico. Through this partnership, the team offers monthly pediatric eye clinics, vision screenings, and free prescription eyeglasses to children. Because of this partnership, children who were previously unable to access medical treatment now have an opportunity to receive the care they deserve.  The organization also focuses on fundraising initiatives to establish operating rooms and acquire equipment for providing surgical care.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, Little Eyes International is constantly working to make a difference in the lives of children with vision problems.  In addition, through community support and donations, the organization continues to expand its reach and impact, providing vital services. Thus, the organization's efforts contribute significantly to preventing and curing childhood blindness, consequently giving hope and enhancing the future for children in need.
  </p>
  <p>
  Therefore, the goal of Little Eyes International is to ensure that every child, irrespective of their socioeconomic background, has an opportunity to see the world clearly.  Furthermore, they believe vision care is important, especially for the growth and development of children.
